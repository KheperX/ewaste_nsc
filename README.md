# E-waste Mate – Location-Aware Blockchain-Based E-Waste Management System
- As the world becomes increasingly digitalized, e-waste has become a major environmental concern. E-waste (Electronic waste) is any electrical equipment that’s been discarded, unwanted, not working, and nearing or at the end of their useful life. Since e-waste contains hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, improper and inefficient e-waste management can cause many problems that affect the environment and ecosystems. It also results in harm to human health and livelihoods.
To address the problem, we propose a novel software system that efficiently manages the process of e-waste disposal. Our system is designed based on the idea of community engagement for collective action to achieve long-term and sustainable outcomes. It applies blockchain technology to store status and information related to e-waste disposal process. This ensures transparency in data collection and enables users to trace back the e-waste disposal process efficiently. In addition, the system supports a function that can automatically select the appropriate e-waste disposal request based on spatial analysis.

# function
- 1. The mobile e-waste management system application will help users manage their waste in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner.
- 2. Users can easily add garbage items to specify the type of garbage and the amount to be discarded.
- 3. Users can check the status of the trash can to know if the trash can is full or not.
- 4. Users can check the amount of waste collected each time and track progress in increasing waste management efficiency.
- 5. The application can also collect data and statistics on waste delivery.
